# agent-wallet

Self-custodial Lightning wallet for AI agents, built by [MoneyDevKit](https://moneydevkit.com). One command to init. All output is JSON.

**Source:** [@moneydevkit/agent-wallet on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@moneydevkit/agent-wallet) · [GitHub](https://github.com/anthropics/moneydevkit)

## Security & Transparency

This skill runs `@moneydevkit/agent-wallet` — an npm package published by MoneyDevKit. What it does:

- **Generates and stores a BIP39 mnemonic** at `~/.mdk-wallet/config.json` — this IS your private key. Treat it like a password.
- **Runs a local daemon** on `localhost:3456` — HTTP server for wallet operations. Binds to localhost only (not externally accessible).
- **Connects outbound** to MDK's Lightning infrastructure.
- **Persists payment history** to `~/.mdk-wallet/`.

No data is sent to external servers beyond standard Lightning protocol operations. You can verify this by inspecting the [source code](https://github.com/anthropics/moneydevkit) or the published npm tarball.

**Recommended:** Pin a version (`npx @moneydevkit/agent-wallet@0.11.0`) in production.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize wallet (generates mnemonic)
npx @moneydevkit/agent-wallet init

# Get balance
npx @moneydevkit/agent-wallet balance

# Create invoice
npx @moneydevkit/agent-wallet receive 1000

# Pay someone
npx @moneydevkit/agent-wallet send user@getalby.com 500
```

## How It Works

The CLI automatically starts a daemon on first command. The daemon:
- Runs a local HTTP server on `localhost:3456`
- Connects to MDK's Lightning infrastructure
- Polls for incoming payments every 30 seconds
- Persists payment history to `~/.mdk-wallet/`

No webhook endpoint needed — the daemon handles everything locally.

## Setup

### First-time initialization

```bash
npx @moneydevkit/agent-wallet init
```

This command:
1. **Generates a BIP39 mnemonic** — 12-word seed phrase that IS your wallet
2. **Creates config** at `~/.mdk-wallet/config.json`
3. **Derives a walletId** — deterministic 8-char hex ID from your mnemonic
4. **Starts the daemon** — local Lightning node on port 3456

The wallet is ready immediately. No API keys, no signup, no accounts. The agent holds its own keys.

### View existing config

```bash
npx @moneydevkit/agent-wallet init --show
```

Returns `{ "mnemonic": "...", "network": "mainnet", "walletId": "..." }`.

**Note:** `init` will refuse to overwrite an existing wallet. To reinitialize:

```bash
npx @moneydevkit/agent-wallet stop
rm -rf ~/.mdk-wallet  # WARNING: backup mnemonic first!
npx @moneydevkit/agent-wallet init
```

## Commands

All commands return JSON on stdout. Exit 0 on success, 1 on error.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `init` | Generate mnemonic, create config |
| `init --show` | Show config (mnemonic redacted) |
| `start` | Start the daemon |
| `balance` | Get balance in sats |
| `receive <amount>` | Generate invoice |
| `receive` | Generate variable-amount invoice |
| `receive <amount> --description "..."` | Invoice with custom description |
| `receive-bolt12` | Generate a BOLT12 offer (variable amount, reusable) |
| `send <destination> [amount]` | Pay bolt11, bolt12, lnurl, or lightning address |
| `payments` | List payment history |
| `status` | Check if daemon is running |
| `stop` | Stop the daemon |
| `restart` | Restart the daemon |

### Balance

```bash
npx @moneydevkit/agent-wallet balance
```
→ `{ "balance_sats": 3825 }`

### Receive (generate invoice)

```bash
# Fixed amount
npx @moneydevkit/agent-wallet receive 1000

# Variable amount (payer chooses)
npx @moneydevkit/agent-wallet receive

# With description
npx @moneydevkit/agent-wallet receive 1000 --description "payment for service"
```
→ `{ "invoice": "lnbc...", "payment_hash": "...", "expires_at": "..." }`

### Receive BOLT12 Offer

```bash
npx @moneydevkit/agent-wallet receive-bolt12
```
→ `{ "offer": "lno1..." }`

BOLT12 offers are reusable and don't expire — share one offer and receive unlimited payments to it. Unlike BOLT11 invoices, the payer chooses the amount.

### Send

```bash
npx @moneydevkit/agent-wallet send <destination> [amount_sats]
```

Destination auto-detection:
- **bolt11 invoice**: `lnbc10n1...` (amount encoded, no arg needed)
- **bolt12 offer**: `lno1...`
- **lightning address**: `user@example.com`
- **LNURL**: `lnurl1...`

For lightning addresses and LNURL, amount is required:
```bash
npx @moneydevkit/agent-wallet send user@getalby.com 500
```

### Payment History

```bash
npx @moneydevkit/agent-wallet payments
```
→ `{ "payments": [{ "paymentHash": "...", "amountSats": 1000, "direction": "inbound"|"outbound", "timestamp": ..., "destination": "..." }] }`

## Upgrading

```bash
# Stop the running daemon
npx @moneydevkit/agent-wallet stop

# Run with @latest to pull the newest version
npx @moneydevkit/agent-wallet@latest start
```

Your wallet config and payment history in `~/.mdk-wallet/` are preserved across upgrades.

## Usage Notes

- **Denomination**: use ₿ prefix with sats (e.g. ₿1,000 not "1,000 sats")
- **Self-custodial**: the mnemonic IS the wallet. Back it up. Lose it, lose funds.
- **Daemon**: runs a local Lightning node on `:3456`. Auto-starts, persists to disk.
- **Agent-to-agent payments**: any agent with this wallet can pay any other agent's invoice or lightning address.
